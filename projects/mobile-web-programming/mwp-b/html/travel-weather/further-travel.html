			<h4>Further Destinations</h4>
			<p>There are many other detinations besides these that can be visited by train or car.</p>
			
			<h5>Yverdon-les-Bains</h5>
			<p>Yverdon-les-Bains is a lovely lakeside village with beautiful panoramas,
			approximately 2 hours from Basel on the train to Geneva. Allow 1 hour to visit this lovely place.</p>
			
			<h5>Neuchâtel</h5>
			<p>Neuchâtel is another lakeside town on the same lake as Yverdon-les-Bains, approximately 1hr 40 mins from Basel SBB on the train to Geneva. Complete with its own
			Beach, allow anything up to a half day to stop and enjoy this lovely place.</p>
			
			<h5>Engelberg</h5>
			<p>Engelberg is a picturesque village for many things. The resort is a fantastic place to learn to ski, with beginner slopes through to very advanced slopes. Many ski
			schools have native English speakers to get you on your way to skiing like a pro! In addition, you could take a day to ascend the cable cars to 3,000m A.S.L. (10,000ft),
			where there is snow for between 90% and 100% of the year. Mount Titlis, via the rotating cable car <i>Rotair</i> is a fantastic first taste of the beauty of The Alps.
			Also on Mount Titlis is Europe's highest bar, restaurant and gift shop and a galcier palace to explore amazing ice structures. High daytime temperatures typically range
			from -25C in winter through to 8C in summer. Perfect for escaping a hot day down below! Take the train from Basel SBB to Luzern and then a small mountain train from Luzern
			to Engelberg. Total journey time is about 2hr 30 mins to 3 hours.</p>
			
			<h5>Zermatt and The Klein Matterhorn</h5>
			<p>Zermatt, then often follows Engelberg for many, this time being at 4,000m (13,000ft) A.S.L., making this the highest public place in Europe without climbing or hiking.
			Take a train from Basel SBB to Bern or Visp/Brig and change at Visp or Brig to the Matterhorn Express train. This train takes an hour or so to wind through the centre of The
			Alps, arriving at Zermatt. The expense of the cable car to The Klein Matterhorn is worth it for the views on top. Here it is likely that you will experience altitude
			sickness as a feeling of breathlessness and slight tension. Fantastic views of the Matterhorn are possible on good days and for another angle why not try ascending the
			Gornergrat Mountain Train to 3,400m A.S.L. Typically temperatures range from -35C in winter to around -1C in summer. Snow is pretty much guaranteed all year round! 
			Total journey time 3hr 15 mins each way plus 6 hours return to The Klein Matterhorn. Add another 3 hours for visiting Gornergrat via the mountain train.</p>
			
			<h5>Strasbourg</h5>
			<p>Visiting France is possible from Basel SBB station, approximately 1hr 30mins on the train to Brussels or Paris. This is a fantastic city for a day out exploring and
			shopping with good prices and fantastic cuisine! Alternatively, take a train from Basel Badischer Bahnhof to Offenburg and then change to a train to Strasbourg. Take a
			full day to do this trip.</p>
			
			<h5>Milan</h5>
			<p>Take a visit to Italy for a day from Basel SBB station. A train is once hourly direct to Milan Central. Allow a long full day for this with 3hr 30mins travel time each
			way.</p>
			
			<h5>Paris</h5>
			<p>Allow a long full day or preferably a weekend to visit Paris from Basel. Travel time 4 hours each way on SNCF trains.</p>
			
			<h5>Amsterdam</h5>
			<p>Amsterdam from Basel Badischer Bahnhof is a 6 - 11 hour train ride or by plane from Basel EuroAirport only 1 hour.</p>
			
			<h5>Germany</h5>
			<p>Take a day trip from Basel to any of these cities and enjoy the sites and general festivities. Karlsruhe from Basel Badischer Bahnhof (1hr 30 mins). Stuttgart from
			Basel Badischer Bahnhof (2hr 30 mins). Mannheim from Basel Badischer Bahnhof (2 hours). Freiburg (Im Breisgau) from Basel Badischer Bahnhof (30 mins).</p>
