			<h4>Do...</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Make friends with the locals. Residents of Basel and indeed Switzerland are exceptionally friendly and accomodating so go
				say hello!</li>
				<li>Try and learn a little German before arriving or if not, try and pick some up during your visit to help with the basics.</li>
				<li>Go exploring around the city if you have time.</li>
				<li>Apologise and don't be afraid to ask if some speaks English if you don't have enough German to get by! It is forgivable!</li>
				<li>Take time to enjoy the beauty of the city!</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Don't...</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Use public transport without buying a ticket. No matter how tempting it is to run for that tram, rather than waiting 5 minutes,
				the fines are not worth it!</li>
				<li>Put your feet on the seats of trams, buses or trains. This will often attract a very quick CHF80.- (£65) on the spot fine.</li>
				<li>Get hit by a tram. You will be fined for the delay of the tram. No really, you will...</li>
				<li>Litter the city. Baslers are proud of their city and will very happily have a word with you if they see you littering.</li>
				<li>Stand between two tram tracks with the intention of letting two trams pass you at the same time. There isn't enough space
				(personal experience) and then number 3 applies...</li>
			</ol>
