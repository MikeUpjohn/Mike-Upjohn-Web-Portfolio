			<h4>What to See And Do in Basel</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Wander Klein Basel.</b> Take a stroll down Clarastrasse from Messeplatz to Claraplatz and then Schifflände crossing the Mittlere Brücke as you go.
				<i>Time: 30 to 60 minutes.</i></li>
				<li><b>Explore Gross Basel.</b> Explore the back streets and tight alleyways surrounding Markplatz, Barfüsserplatz and Schifflände through to the university.
				<i>Time: 2 hours.</i></li>
				<li><b>Muttenz Castle.</b> Starting from Schifflände, take a stroll through the old city to Barfüsserplatz and than Bankverein. Follow the path from Bankverein
				down to the river and follow for a couple of miles on the outer bank. At the first stream entering from the right, turn and follow the stream for another couple
				of miles to St.Jakob Stadium. Here, follow road signs to Muttenz and after another 40 minutes walk, arrive at Muttenz Rail Station. From here pass through Muttenz
				village and up to the castle, where 3 buildings with spectacular views remain. Perfect for a warm, sunny, spring day!
				<i>Time: 4 to 6 hours.</i></li>
				<li><b>Spalentor Town Gate</b> From Schifflände turn upstream to the university, before vearing a slight left. Follow the streets for a kilometer or so to reach
				Basel's magnificent town gate.
				<i>Time: 30 to 60 minutes.</i></li>
				<li><b>Feldschlösschen Factory</b> Out of town, approximately 12km is the Feldschlösschen factory at Rheinfelden, a local light beer of Basel and larger areas of Switzerland.
				Guided tours can be booked to see the factory and possibly even sample some of the delights on offer! Odd opening hours, book before arrival!
				<i>Time: 2 hour tour (6 hours including train and explore of Rheinfelden)</i></li>
				<li><b>Swim in the Rhein</b> Take a tram to Wettsteinplatz and enter the river on the right side of the bridge when looking at Gross-Basel. Swim down river two bridges to
				Johanniterbrücke. Follow the yellow markers under the bridge for the correct archways to pass through and give way to river traffic at all times. Don't swim beyond
				Johanniterbrücke, as you enter a large industrial port. If you do, choose your country or immigration, France to the left, Germany to the right, and start preparing your
				story for the border police who will pick you up when you get out.
				<i>Time: 30 to 60 minutes.</i></li>
				<li><b>Visit the Münster.</b> On odd days, the Münster opens its door to allow visitors to look round. Check coming dates on <a href='http://www.basel.ch'>Basel City Website</a>.
				<i>Time: 30 to 60 minutes.</i></li>
				<li><b>Sit by the Rhein</b> Massive expanses of the river edge have been equipped with large steps, doubling up as seats to allow you to sit, relax and pick up a tan in
				the summer. Feel free to take food, music, beer and barbecues to enjoy the evening. The area is well lit and in summer it is entirely possible to sit by the river,
				comfortably until 3am or longer. Make sure you take all litter and beware of steps under the water as they are slippery and the drop of the last step is 4 metres into deep
				water.
				<i>Time: As long as you like.</i></li>
